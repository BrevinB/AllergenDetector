# AllergenDetector

AllergenDetector is an iOS application that scans product barcodes and warns users when allergens are detected. Users can select allergens to avoid, view a history of scanned items and, as of this version, export that history to a CSV file.

## Exporting History

Open the **History** screen and tap the **Export** button to share a CSV file of all recorded scans. The file includes the barcode, product name, date scanned, and whether the item was marked safe.
